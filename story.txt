The trip to Berlin had been a gruesome one that all started at the Flughafen (airport).
Dr. Mehlhase had recently encountered a porsche on the highway that cut her off in traffic.
I saw a BMW at the Rammstein Flughafen parking lot.
The hund ate all the gebaeck at the Berlin baeckerei.
Then a woman driving a Porsche drove by wearing a Dirndel.
Her husband was in the passenger seat wearing Lederhose.
He was holding an Apfelkuchen keeping it away from the hund.
It seemed he was eyeing the Gebaeck hungrily, he must have had a sweeth tooth.
I had gebaech from baeckerei at Berlin Flughafen.
