The trip to Berlin had been a gruesome one that all started at the Flughafen (airport).
Dr. Mehlhase had recently encountered a porsche on the highway that cut her off in traffic.
I saw a BMW at the Rammstein Flughafen parking lot.
The hund ate all the gebaeck at the Berlin baeckerei.
Then a woman driving a Porsche drove by wearing a Dirndel.
Her husband was in the passenger seat wearing Lederhose.
They stoped to some Brot and a drink a a Biergarten.
